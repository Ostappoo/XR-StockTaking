# Google Sheets

The Localization package allows you to synchronize [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets) data with the content of a String Table Collection. By default, this feature can synchronize a String Tableâ€™s keys, values, and comment metadata. You can also add support for additional data through scripts.
